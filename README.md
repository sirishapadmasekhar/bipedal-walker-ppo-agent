# Bipedal Walker PPO Agent

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent trained to walk using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** in the `BipedalWalker-v3` environment from **OpenAI Gym**. The agent learns bipedal locomotion from scratch through interaction with a continuous control environment, using reward signals to guide policy updates.

## Objective

To train a simulated bipedal robot to walk autonomously using deep reinforcement learning — without imitation learning, predefined motion policies, or manual control logic.

## Overview

- **Environment:** OpenAI Gym `BipedalWalker-v3`
- **Algorithm:** PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Framework:** [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) (PyTorch)
- **Observation Space:** 24 continuous inputs  
  - Includes hull angle/velocity, joint angles, ground contacts, lidar-based terrain sensing
- **Action Space:** 4-dimensional continuous vector (torques to hips and knees)
- **Training:** 1M+ timesteps using a reward function encouraging forward motion and penalizing inefficient torque usage
